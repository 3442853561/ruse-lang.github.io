# Introduction to Ruse

Ruse is a project to create an embedded Scheme for Rust, but what does this
mean? Well, it means that Ruse intends to implement the R7RS Scheme
specification and be usable with Rust code in a way similar to the way Lua
interacts with C code.

As the project continues to develop this blog will be used by the developers
to explain and explore ideas, both about Scheme and Ruse specifically, and
about working in Rust.

If you're interested, we're always happy to have new contributors!
