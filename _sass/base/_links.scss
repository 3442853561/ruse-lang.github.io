// ## Base: Links
//
// Links are the cornerstone of HTML (they're what makes the text 'hyper') and
// so link styles are one of the most important part of any website design. It
// should be obvious what state a link is in, and links should provide the same
// information they provide on every site. This means that all the usual states
// of links have to properly accounted for, including `:visited`.

// Links default to using a color different from the surrounding text and
// being underlined. You can always change this, but note that users should
// have some way besides color to identify links, and it should be clear enough
// that they are never confused about what is a link and what isn't.
a {
	color: $color-link;

	// A lighter version of the same color indicates a hovered state.
	&:hover,
	&:focus {
		color: $color-link--focus;
		outline: 0;
	}

	// And the color changes entirely when the link is clicked.
	&:active {
		color: $color-bg--off-dark;
		outline: 0;
	}
}
